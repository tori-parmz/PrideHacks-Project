# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Overview

SafeHaven is built using modern web technologies such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Redux. It provides a user-friendly interface for connecting with like-minded individuals, engaging in conversations, and exploring informative blog posts related to LGBTQIA+ topics.

## Technologies Used

SafeHaven is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state.
- NPM: A package manager for installing and managing project dependencies.

## Getting Started

To run the SafeHeaven web app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/safeheaven.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd safeheaven`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance and prepares the app for deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

Ejecting from Create React App allows you to have full control over the configuration and dependencies of your project. It's an irreversible process and should be done with caution.
