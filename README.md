# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Empowering Community Voices
Combating Isolation and Loneliness
Providing Resources and Support for their voice
Creating a Positive Online Experience

## What it does ü§î
People could chat with one other
They could post blogs.
FAQ Sections
Micro Social Network

## How we built it üé®
React.js on the front-end with styling done in Material UI
Firebase for OAuth
Socket.io for Chat
Node + Express for Backend
Figma, Photoshop and After Effects for designing & crafting assets

## Design üé®
We were heavily inspired by the revised version of Double Diamond design process, which not only includes visual design, but a full-fledged research cycle in which you must discover and define your problem before tackling your solution & then finally deploy it.

## Double-Diamond

Discover: a deep dive into the problem we are trying to solve.
Define: synthesizing the information from the discovery phase into a problem definition.
Develop: think up solutions to the problem.
Deliver: pick the best solution and build that.
Moreover, we utilized design tools like Figma, Photoshop & Illustrator to prototype our designs before doing any coding. Through this, we are able to get iterative feedback so that we spend less time re-writing code.

## Challenges we ran into üò§
We built the whole project from scratch which involved crafting a ton of UI components which we had to plug in with the backend. Furthermore, we invested a lot of time in finetuning the whole UX flow later on which did unnecessarily consumed a bit of time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of ‚ú®
We are proud of finishing the project on time which seemed like a tough task as we started working on it quite late due to other commitments. We were also able to add most of the features that we envisioned for the app during ideation. And as always, working overnight was pretty fun! :)

This project was a notable accomplishment for us because it presented a unique experience compared to other generic hackathons. We engaged in thorough brainstorming and extensive research, which culminated in a satisfying sense of accomplishment upon successfully completing the project.

## What we learned üôå
Proper sleep is very important! :p Well, a lot of things, both summed up in technical & non-technical sides. Also not to mention, we enhanced our googling and Stackoverflow searching skills during the hackathon :)

## What's next for Bloomly üöÄ
We believe that our App has great potential. We just really want this project to have a positive impact on people's lives! We would love to make it more scalable & cross-platform so that the user interaction increases to a great extent. Additionally, we intend to continue improving the UI & integrating specialized features for an even more premium experience.
